# brain-tumor-detection-vit-using-AI
This project uses a Vision Transformer (ViT) model to detect brain tumors from MRI images. The model is trained and evaluated using a public dataset.  Dataset The dataset used is available on Kaggle:   [Brain MRI Images for Brain Tumor Detection](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/navoneel/brain-mri-images-for-brain-tumor-detection)
